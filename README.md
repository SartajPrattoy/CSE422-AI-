# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project was developed as part of the **CSE422 - Artificial Intelligence coursework**. It focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using various machine learning models. By leveraging clinical and demographic features from a renowned health dataset, the project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to determine the most effective approach for heart disease prediction.

## Features
- **Course Context:** Developed as a comprehensive project for the CSE422 Artificial Intelligence course.
- **Dataset:** UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (sourced via Kaggle).
- **Algorithms Used:** KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

## Results
The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy of **95.93%**, demonstrating its strength in capturing complex relationships in the data. Logistic Regression followed with decent performance, while SVM and KNN had comparatively lower accuracies.

## Key Highlights
- Thorough exploration of data preprocessing, including handling null values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Comprehensive comparison of machine learning algorithms with visualization of results.
- Insightful analysis of heart disease risk factors and patterns through the lens of machine learning.

## Impact
This project showcases the application of machine learning in healthcare for early detection of heart disease. It contributes to the academic understanding of ML techniques while offering valuable insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers.
