## Repository Name Recommendations

### Current Name: `CSE422-AI-`
**Issues with current name:**
- Too generic and doesn't describe the project content
- Ends with a hyphen which looks incomplete
- Doesn't indicate the specific domain (heart disease prediction)

### Suggested Names:
1. **`CSE422-Heart-Disease-Prediction`** ⭐ (Recommended)
   - Clearly indicates course context
   - Describes the project's purpose
   - Professional and descriptive

2. **`Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML`**
   - Focuses on the project's main goal
   - Indicates machine learning approach
   - Domain-specific and clear

3. **`CSE422-Healthcare-ML-Project`**
   - Broader scope indicator
   - Maintains course context
   - Suitable if planning to expand to other healthcare ML projects

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. File Organization & Naming
- **Fixed typo**: `heart_desease_data.csv` → `heart_disease_data.csv`
- **Standardized naming**:
